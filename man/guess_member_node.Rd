\title{Guess the Member Node}
\usage{
guess_member_node(cn = "PROD", pid)
}
\arguments{
\item{cn}{(character) A character vector of coordinate nodes to search.  Defaults to "PROD".
Can be set to any combination of ("PROD", "STAGING", "STAGING2", "SANDBOX", "SANDBOX2", "DEV", "DEV2").}

\item{pid}{(character) The Datone unique object identifier.}
}
\description{
Guess the member node that stores a Dataone object based on its
unique identifier (\code{pid}) and coordinating node (\code{cn}).  In most cases
the object is stored on the Production ("PROD") Node, however this function can
search across all coordinating nodes.  If only one member node is identified this
function returns the member node as a Dataone "MNode" object.  If multiple member
nodes are identified a vector of nodes is printed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
The following two calls are equivalent:
mn <- guess_member_node("doi:10.18739/A2G287")
mn <- guess_member_node("PROD", "doi:10.18739/A2G287")

Search all coordinating nodes:
cn = c("PROD", "STAGING", "STAGING2", "SANDBOX", "SANDBOX2", "DEV", "DEV2"))
mn <- guess_member_node(cn, "doi:10.18739/A2G287")
}
